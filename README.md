   The Book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold is a begginner friendly book that features alot of pentesting projects that are begginer friendly and somewhat easy to understand. 

The book is avaible on Amazon here: https://www.amazon.de/Black-Hat-Python-2nd-Programming/dp/1718501129
###### :warning: Note: I copied some (if not most of the bigger texts) of the text from the book directly into the code! :warning:

## Projects
###### I'll maybe also add a few other projects here but for now it's just the code from the Book :+1:

So far:

- [x] TCP-Client
- [x] UDP-Client
- [x] TCP-Server
- [ ] NetCat (uploaded but kinda broken (I will try to fix it tho in the near future))

:warning: After finishing the NetCat, I will take a small brake and study some other books, because I don't fully understand some of the code. :I :warning:
