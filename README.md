# Code-from-Black-Hat-Python

## This Repo is full of Code from the book "Black-Hat-Python" from Tim Arnold.
   The Book "Black Hat Python" from Tim Arnold is a begginner friendly book that features alot of  pentesting projects that are begginer friendly and somewhat easy to understand. 
## Projects
###### I'll maybe also add a few other projects here but for now it's just the code from the Book :+1:

So far:

- [x] TCP-Client
- [x] UDP-Client
- [x] TCP-Server
- [ ] NetCat.py

:warning: After finishing the NetCat, I will take a small brake and work on some other books/projects, because I dont fully understand some of the code...  :warning:
